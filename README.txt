"When all hope is gone, one can still find consolation in reading Schopenhauer. No wait, Scnhauer."
--Steven Kaas

Probably you need to install Selenium for Python to run this program. I could only get it to work in Python 2, because Selenium is only built for Python 2.7 I guess.
Run main.py to run the program.

In honor of Protobowl's readme, this project's readme will also be an incoherent mess. In honor of Protobowl, this project will also be a piece of crap.

Real holy laughter in solute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

Schopenhauer is a bot that plays Protobowl, an online version of Quiz Bowl. It was hacked together in a relatively short time by the 2015 Inglemoor Quiz Bowl team. It is very good at answering Protobowl questions, due to its use of a revolutionary new tactic known as "cheating".
