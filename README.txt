In honor of Protobowl's readme, this readme will also be an incoherent mess.

What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
Schopenhauer! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
Schopenhauer! Schopenhauer! Nightmare of Schopenhauer! Schopenhauer the loveless! Mental Schopenhauer! Schopenhauer the heavy judger of men!
Schopenhauer the incomprehensible prison! Schopenhauer the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Schopenhauer whose buildings are judgment! Schopenhauer the vast stone of war! Schopenhauer the stunned governments!
Schopenhauer whose mind is pure machinery! Schopenhauer whose blood is running money! Schopenhauer whose fingers are ten armies! Schopenhauer whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Schopenhauer whose ear is a smoking tomb!
Schopenhauer whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Schopenhauer whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Schopenhauer whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Schopenhauer whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!
Schopenhauer whose love is endless oil and stone! Schopenhauer whose soul is electricity and banks! Schopenhauer whose poverty is the specter of genius! Schopenhauer whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Schopenhauer whose name is the Mind!
Schopenhauer in whom I sit lonely! Schopenhauer in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Schopenhauer! Cocksucker in Schopenhauer! Lacklove and manless in Schopenhauer!
Schopenhauer who entered my soul early! Schopenhauer in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Schopenhauer who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Schopenhauer whom I abandon! Wake up in Schopenhauer! Light streaming out of the sky!
Schopenhauer! Schopenhauer! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
They broke their backs lifting Schopenhauer to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!
Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!
Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten yearsâ€™ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
Real holy laughter in solute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies good to eat a thousand years.

TODO: Make this actual thing at some point.
